/*
Create a "Choose Your Own Adventure" game using an object. In these kind of
games, the player is in a room and can move to other rooms to the north, east,
south or west.

To start the game, run this file with Node as usual. To stop the game, press
Ctrl-C.

It has a currentRoom property to store which room the player is in.

Give your object methods for:

- Starting the game in the correct room when passed a room name parameter
- Moving the player to another room when passed a direction parameter

The functionality for running a game has been provided for you. It first prompts
the player to enter the starting room. Then it will ask players to to type in a
direction (north/east/south/west) that they want to move in.

An object containing one object per room has been provided for you. Take your
time to read it carefully. The rooms look something like this:
+-----------+-----------+
|           |           |
|   Hall    | Classroom |
|           |           |
+-----------------------+
|           |
|  Library  |
|           |
+-----------+

----------------------------------------------------------

Stretch goal: what happens if you try to move in a direction that the current
room doesn't allow? For example if you are in the Classroom and you try to move
east? If there is a bug in your code, try to fix it.
